# Soil Erosion Assessment Tool

This is our final project in the 'Image Processing' course.
Our goal was to create a tool that will provide a farmer with a necessary tool to assess the extent to which his soil is sensitive to soil erosion.
Currently, the tool only takes into factor the field's gradient, while soil erosion is affected by many more factors, our goal is to create a more extensive tool that will take into account all those other factors.

To use the tool, you will need to use the Stramlit library, and run the streamlit_app.py by using the command: 'streamlit run streamlit_app.py'
You will then be introduced to the local web app, there you will upload the image you would like to process.
The image must be taken from OpenStreetMap.comm

## Currently, the output is very inaccurate, and must not be taken as reference.
